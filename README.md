# Sales-Data-Analysis-Power BI-project
 
Purpose: Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

Description: In this project, we have dived into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights.
We have explored sales trends over time, identified the best-selling products, calculated revenue metrics such as 
total sales and profit margins, and created visualizations to present our findings effectively.
This project showcases the ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling us to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
